Problems with game idea
-metas / cards that are not rare but very powerful
-if a player gets one really good card they will keep building around it, with no need to discover new synergies --> solution: reduced xp gain

What I want to encourage:
-discover new synergies --> Specific synergies when discovered play a unique animation and rewards gems
-experimentaton --> every time you try a build you haven't tried bvefore, you gain way more XP
-problem solving against a specific build --> spedcific Champions to defeat with guaranteed card rewards.
-adaptation to sircumstances, environments --> Changing bonuses to different abilities every 3 days
-trying out new builds --> With the same deck, you can only earn a certain amount of XP

What feeling do I want players to ffel:
surprise(discovering synergies)
status(showing off player max ranking in a league)
belonging to a community(trading on discord, reddit)
